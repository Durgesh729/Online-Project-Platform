# Projects Search Bar - User Guide

## How to Use the Enhanced Search Feature

The Projects section now has a powerful search bar that helps you find projects quickly by filtering across multiple fields.

### Accessing the Search Bar

1. Navigate to the **Projects** section (accessible from the navigation board)
2. Look for the search bar at the top of the page (marked with a 🔍 icon)
3. No login required for basic search functionality

---

## What You Can Search For

The search bar now filters projects by the following criteria:

### 1. **Project Name**
- Type any part of the project name
- Example: Searching "AI" will find "AI Research Project", "Machine Learning with AI", etc.

### 2. **Domain Name**
- Search by the project's domain field
- Example: Searching "Web" will find all projects in "Web Development", "Web Design", etc.

### 3. **Mentee Name**
- Find projects by the name of students working on them
- Example: Searching "John" will show all projects assigned to mentees named John

### 4. **Mentee Email**
- Search by mentee email addresses
- Example: Searching "student@" will show projects with mentees having that email domain

## Search Features

### ✨ Case-Insensitive
- Searches ignore uppercase/lowercase differences
- "AI" = "ai" = "Ai" = "aI"

### ✨ Partial Matching
- You don't need to type the full word
- "dev" matches "Developer", "Development", "Device"

### ✨ Real-Time Updates
- Results update instantly as you type
- No need to press Enter or click a search button

### ✨ Multi-Field Search
- Searches all fields simultaneously
- One search query checks project name, domain, and all mentee information

## Search Examples

| What You Type | What It Finds |
|--------------|---------------|
| `AI` | Projects with "AI" in name or domain, or mentees with "AI" in their name/email |
| `web dev` | Projects containing "web dev" anywhere |
| `john` | All projects assigned to mentees named John |
| `@gmail` | All projects with mentees using Gmail addresses |
| `machine` | Projects with "Machine" in name or domain (like "Machine Learning") |

---

## Tips for Better Searching

1. **Start with shorter terms**: Use "AI" instead of "Artificial Intelligence"
2. **Use unique keywords**: If you remember a unique word from the project name, use it
3. **Try different fields**: If searching by name doesn't work, try domain or mentee name
4. **Clear the search**: Delete all text to see all projects again

### What Was Fixed

**Before:**
- ❌ Search icon overlapped with input field
- ❌ Could only search by project name and domain
- ❌ Search was limited and not accurate

**After:**
- ✅ Icon positioned perfectly without overlap
- ✅ Search by project name, domain, mentee name, and mentee email
- ✅ Accurate partial matching with case-insensitive search
- ✅ Real-time dynamic updates

## Troubleshooting

### Search Not Working?
1. Make sure you're typing at least one character
2. Check if there are any projects loaded (you should see project cards)
3. Try clearing the search and typing again

### Not Finding Expected Results?
1. Try shorter, more general search terms
2. Check spelling of names/domains
3. Remember: search is partial - "AI" should match "AI Project"

### Icon Overlapping Input?
- This has been fixed! If you still see overlap, try refreshing the page (Ctrl+R or Cmd+R)
